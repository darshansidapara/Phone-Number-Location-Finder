#### **Step 5: Frontend Files**

Ensure your frontend files are placed in the correct directories as shown in the structure in Step 1. **No changes are needed to your `script.js` file.** The relative URL `/get_info` will work perfectly because Flask is serving both the HTML page and the API from the same domain.
